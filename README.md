# color collector

This is a first attempt at creating my own API. There is limited (read: no) functionality at the moment but I'll be continuing to work on this project in the future.

### About

My initial plans for this project were to build of a repo of Wikipedia color names and hex codes that I found on [dariusk's corpora repo](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora). I wanted to give the user an opportunity to find random colors, rename the colors in the API, and then to be able to build color palettes of their own.

I took a lot of time this week combing through the DWD resources available to get a better understanding of what REST vs CRUD is.
